           <p class="Q1text">When is the last time to purchase home products?</p>
          <img class="A1" src="images/A1.png" width="494">
          <p class="A1text">Last time I bought something for my home was during black Friday and I found a great deal of <span>a console table</span>. I always wanted a console table but it’s not the first priority of the furniture hunt, so I waited until I found the best price/style I can get.

          <!-- Question 2 -->
          <img class="Q2" src="images/Q2.png" width="358">
          <p class="Q2text">Do you have any experience of furnishing? Do you enjoy it?</p>
          <img class="A2" src="images/A2.png" width="494">
          <p class="A2text">Yes, I have experience of decorating my home. Well, I would say Half half, as I feel it was difficult to visualize the final style in the beginning, and it took a lot of time to search for the right furniture, but I enjoyed seeing the final outcome. The planning part is hard,  I think a lot of fuss happened in the process of planning because there isn’t a go-to-place for all my requirement. </p>
         <!-- question 3 -->
         <img class="Q3" src="images/Q3.png" width="245">
         <p class="Q3text">What do you do in planning?</p>
         <img class="A3" src="images/A3.png" width="494">
         <p class="A3text">I would gather inspirations online, or even do a planning sketch myself. I mainly look for style inspirations on <span>Pinterest</span> or brands I follow on Instagram, along with some furniture retail websites. After settled on a style, I would search for furniture and decorations online with specific keywords relating to the style, or I would go to a physical furniture store to look for furniture that would match the overall style. After that, I would use a measuring tape to meature dimension. There are  Some websites or apps do VR visualization, like preview the product in real space,  but I find them not 100% accurate. So I barely use it.

         <p class="Q4text">What makes a cozy home?</p>
         <img class="A4" src="images/A4.png" width="494">
         <p class="A4text">Whatever you feel comfortable living in. No matter what style, but more importantly it should fit your day to day needs.</p>

         <p class="Q5text">What are the things that you like best about your home?</p>
         <img class="A5" src="images/A5.png" width="480">
         <p class="A5text">I like the dining area, as I matched the <span>dining table</span> and <span>chairs</span> myself. I put in some effort and found them on different websites. It turned out a lot better than buying a set. I did my best choosing furniture, and every corner feels cozy with a cohesive style.</p>

         <p class="Q6text">What do you want to improve in your home?</p>
         <img class="A6" src="images/A6.png" width="480">
         <p class="A6text">I’d like to get more <span>decorative pieces</span>, such as wall arts or plants, as my current wall looks a bit empty and there are still some corners that can be leveled up with better ideas.
I like home products that are well designed in both practical and visually appealing ways.</p>

         <!-- question 7 -->
         <img class="Q7" src="images/Q7.png" width="358">
         <p class="Q7text">What value do you consider most for a furniture? How do you define the value?</p>
         <img class="A7" src="images/A7.png" width="494">
         <p class="A7text">I care about practicability the most.  Because I think it is the most important if a furniture can be well utilized in a space and makes people living in the space comfortable and benefit from the convenience.  The practicability of a furniture or a home product is whether it serves your daily needs. i.e. I bought an automatic <span> coffee machine</span> as I drink coffee every morning and owning it saved me a lot of time heading out getting coffee, so I think it is practical. And also I will visualize myself or guests coming to my home using a certain piece of furniture before buying it. If I find it can be well utilized, I will think it has the value of practicability. And I hope that not only me but other people, such as family members or<span> my pet</span>, also enjoy using the furniture or home product I bought.
